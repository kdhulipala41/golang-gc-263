- Wrote up a simple program that allocates 500,000 bytes as long-lived heap memory
- Then in a loop for a minute, allocate 20,480 bytes every 100ms (short-lived, garbage pretty immediately)
- Interesting notes: it's really hard to make short-lived allocations as Go's compiler is smart enough to optimize out dumb allocations
- Sawtooth pattern as a result of GOMEMLIMIT being approached, showing Go's GC in action when approaching the target
