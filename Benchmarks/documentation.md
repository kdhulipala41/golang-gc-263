This directory will contain benchmarks that we use to stress the golang garbage collector.

The benchmarks directory contains tests that are intended to represent real-life applications as provided by the internal golang sweet library. This library has been used to actually test implementation changes to the runtime of Go, so it serves as a great way to benchmark our adjustments to the Golang garbage collector.
